Please write a python program where X,Y, N,M will be input from the user.


charge for n number of 2 wheeler will be  n*x where x is price paid of one 2 wheeler at parking;
charge for m number of 4 wheeler will be  m*y where y is price paid of one 4 wheeler at parking;

n=input("enter number of 2 wheelers : ")
m=input("enter number of 4 wheelers : ")
x=input("enter the parking rate for 2 wheelers : ")
y=input("enter the parking rate for 4 wheelers : ")
total_of_2wheelers = int(n)*int(x)
total_of_4wheelers = int(m)*int(y)
total =total_of_2wheelers + total_of_4wheelers
print("your total parking fee collected is : ",total)
